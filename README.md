# Project: Space Mission Explorer

Description:
Develop a web application that allows users to explore information about space missions, including details about spacecraft, launch dates, objectives, and related images.

Features:

Backend (ASP.NET):

    API Integration: Use ASP.NET to create a backend that integrates with external APIs (such as NASA's API) to fetch information about space missions.
    Data Model: Design a database schema to store fetched mission data and related images.
    API Endpoints: Create API endpoints that provide mission details, images, and search functionalities.

Frontend:

    Mission List: Display a list of space missions with basic information like mission name and launch date.
    Mission Details: Show detailed information about a selected mission, including spacecraft details, objectives, and relevant images.
    Image Gallery: Provide a gallery of images associated with each mission.
    Search and Filters: Implement search and filtering options to allow users to find missions based on keywords, dates, or objectives.
    Responsive Design: Ensure the frontend is responsive and works well on various devices.
    Interactive UI: Create an engaging user interface with interactive elements for navigation and exploration.
    User Authentication: Implement user registration and login functionality to allow users to save favorite missions or create personalized collections.

Technologies:

Backend (ASP.NET):

    ASP.NET Core: Use ASP.NET Core to build the backend API.
    Entity Framework Core: Utilize Entity Framework Core to handle database operations.
    External API: Integrate with external space-related APIs to fetch mission data and images.
    Authentication: Implement ASP.NET Core Identity for user authentication.

Frontend:

    HTML/CSS/JavaScript: Use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for building the frontend interface.
    Bootstrap: Utilize the Bootstrap framework for responsive design and UI components.
    AJAX: Use AJAX to fetch data from the backend API asynchronously.
    Frontend Framework: Optionally, consider using a frontend framework like React or Vue.js for enhanced interactivity.

Potential Challenges (everything):

    API Integration: Fetching and handling data from external APIs.
    Data Storage: Designing an efficient database schema to store mission information and images.
    User Authentication: Implementing secure user authentication and authorization.
    Frontend Design: Creating an intuitive and visually appealing user interface.
    Search and Filters: Implementing efficient search and filtering mechanisms.
    Image Handling: Displaying and managing images associated with each mission.
    Responsive Design: Ensuring the application works well on different devices.
